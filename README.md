# PCB Assembly Jig Generator

Ease PCB assembly with automatically generated 3D printed jigs. Achieve well aligned connectors. No motor skills required.

Jigit is "equal opportunity" software. It helps you save time, material and money. If you use this tool, you are obligated
to compensate the developer fairly. Details of what "equal opportunity" means and your obligations are in [this page](EQUAL-OPPORTUNITY.md).

Starting with a PCB design, the project aims to achieve this workflow:

 1. Create a 3D printable jig design from a PCB design.
 2. Print jig.
 3. Mount components and PCB on jig. If tolerance issues, tweak parameters, goto step 1.
 4. Solder away for perfect results... every time !
