# PCB Assembly Jig Generator

Ease PCB assembly with automatically generated 3D printed jigs. Achieve well aligned connectors. No motor skills required.

Starting with a PCB design, the project aims to achieve this workflow:

 1. Create a 3D printable jig design from a PCB design.
 2. Print jig.
 3. Mount components and PCB on jig. If tolerance issues, tweak parameters, goto step 1.
 4. Solder away for perfect results... every time !
